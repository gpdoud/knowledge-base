As I continue my deep dive into React, I found that, for me, there is a better way to learn React than watching videos of others building applications with React. I'm posting this for others find learning React from videos difficult.

I'll assume that if you have just started learning programming, I believe there are better programming languages to start learning than React. My recommendation would be to learn programming using Python. It is a C-based language that is simpler to learn but provides the knowledge of C-like syntax that so many programming languages use.

Now, an alternative to learning React for those that know programming concepts, my suggestion is to go to the react.dev web page and study the individual constructs of React one at a time. By learning what each construct does, what its used for, and its syntax, you can relate each one to the general programming constructs you already know. Here is an example showing why learning React is harder than learning other programming languages.

Assume you knew Python and began learning C#. You wanted to learn how you declare a property in C#, you'd discover that declaring a property in C# is similar to declaring a property/variable in Python. But the way you declare a property in React is nothing like Python!

If you browsed over the React documentation, you'd run across a 'useState()' construct. When I first saw 'useState()', I had no idea what it did. After reading the docs about 'useState()', I discovered how a component in React creates a property and allows that property to be changed. Once I read that, I made the connection to declaring a property in Python or C# even though the syntax is very different. From that moment, I found learning React was much easier for me to learn versus watching others build components with React.

I want to be clear that I am NOT telling others what to do. I don't give unscolicited advice. I'm just providing an alternative that helped me learn React much quicker than watching those videos.
